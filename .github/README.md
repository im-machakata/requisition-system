# What is this?

This is a very basic Online Requisition System. 

## Users

The system can be used by 3 different users who are: **The Admin**, **The Accounts** and **The Supervisors**.

## Functionality

All users can create a new requisition from the three defined requisition types. However, there are a couple of things each user can do that the other can not.

### The Admin

The admin can lookup or add a new clients to the system.

### The Accounts

The accounts can disburse funds to any approved requisitions. They can not approve any requisitions on their own.

### The Supervisor

The supervisor is the only one who can approve or reject requisitions. This leaves the requisition open for the accounts team to disburse the funds.

## Design System

The documentation provided had a desktop theme and some effort were made to make it look good on desktops than on mobile devices. The entire system was built using Bootstrap 5.
